data attributes on ...

#world

  data-gravity="<number> <number>"

    this property has a two-number string, representing the
    x- and the y- direction of gravity. While you might think
    gravity only goes down, it doesn't have to!


walls, paddles, bars

  data-key-...="..., ..., ..."

    These attributes let you move something around using
    whatever key you want! The keys are normal text labels,
    so if you want to use the 'w' key to move something down,
    you can:

      <div class="bar" data-key-one="w, 0, 0.1"></div>

    This now makes our bar move when we press 'w', and it will
    move it 0 units to the right, 0.1 units down. If we want
    to use the down arrow instead, you can do that too:

      <div class="bar" data-key-down="down, 0, 0.1"></div>

    Or we can make the down arrow make the bar go up!

      <div class="bar" data-key-down="down, 0, -0.1"></div>

    Now it'll move right by 0 units and -0.1 units down,
    which means 0.1 up!

    We can also add as many of these keys as we want, as
    long as the data-key- prefix is used. So we can use
    "data-key-one", as well as "data-key-mongoose". As long
    as no two attributes have exactly the same name, things
    will work. This, however, won't:

      <div class="bar" data-key-down="s, 0, 0.1" data-key-down="down, 0, 0.1"></div>

    If there are multiple attributes with the same name,
    the last one "wins", and only its code is used. So
    remember to use unique names after "data-key-"!

walls, paddles, bars, balls

   data-density="..."

    this indicates the weigh-to-size ratio for the element.
    If you have a huge thing, with a density zero, it's going
    to "weight" next to nothing, and the physics engine will
    treat it as such.

  data-friction="..."

    this indicates how much "touching another thing" affects
    where this thing is going. Usually this won't seem to do
    much, but if objects at speed hit each other, friction
    will slow them down and change the direction they're
    going in

  data-bounciness="..."

    this indicates how much an object slows down (or rather
    transfers its energy) when it hits something else. The
    attribute is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means
    "no energy is transfered, this thing bounces perfectly"
    and 1 means "all energy is transfered, this thing
    stops moving once it hits something".
